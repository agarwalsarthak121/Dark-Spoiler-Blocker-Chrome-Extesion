# :sparkles: Dark: Hide Spoilers - Chrome Extension <img src="Sacred_Games_Title.png" width="64"/>

This extension will save you from reading any Dark Spoilers as well as visual images. <br/>

I am not an expert with Google Chrome Development and this is my first extension made ever. 

# Features
- **Spoiler Blocking**: Searches entire web page and replaces Spoilers with text `##[TEXT BLOCKED: SPOILER DETECTED]`
- **Image Blurring**: Blurs the neighbouring Images which are relevant and might reveal the Spoiler information.
- **Customizable**: As you have the source code, you can customize it as per your needs ;) 

# How To Use?
- Clone this repository or download as a zip file
- Incase you downloaded as a zip, unzip it
- Open Google Chrome
- Go to `chrome://extensions`
- Click on `Load Unpacked` which you can see in the top left side.
- Select the path where you cloned/downloaded this project.
- That's all :D
